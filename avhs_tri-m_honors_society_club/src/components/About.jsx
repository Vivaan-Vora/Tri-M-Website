          Welcome to the Tri-M Honors Society Website! We are a prestigious
          society dedicated to recognizing and promoting excellence in music
          education. We are focused on helping high schoolers earn their service
          hours, giving them opportunities to perform in public and give them
          live experience, as well as guiding them along their way to excellence
          in their musical skills.
